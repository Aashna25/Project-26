An Easy Weeknight Pasta That’s Just Rich Enough
This quick and easy dinner is inspired by penne alla vodka, but made simpler with fewer ingredients — namely, the vodka. I assure you, it won’t be missed, and the omission makes it more kid-friendly.

Instead, this pasta sauce is just four ingredients: onion, garlic, a can of crushed tomatoes, and cream. That last ingredient is what makes the sauce extra special, but it’s not poured with a heavy hand. A generous splash is really all you need to add richness to the sauce without making this dinner feel too indulgent.
The result is a comforting pasta dinner that will likely become a habit throughout these chilly winter months.
